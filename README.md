Basic IO Interface is a cross-platform library designed to provide easy to use classes to render graphics on the screen, capture mouse and keyboard inputs and play audio files.

The library uses GDI+ on Windows and X11 Unix base operating systems.

Build
-----

For the time being the project uses a simple Makefile, I will migrate it to CMake once the project is more mature.

To build manually:

```sh
 make
```
